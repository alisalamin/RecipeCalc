Hello,

If you're looking for the client, please note that due to the emphasis on testing the Unit Test project is effectively the client interface for this solution, and the current means by which you run the calculator functions.


After you're all set up with the DataAccess layer (see README.txt in the Data folder), you should be able to successfully run the tests in the Visual Studio Test Explorer.
