Hi there,

In this business layer you'll notice quite a few of the "Manager" classes have NotImplementedException scaffolding. These classes exist more to fill out the design for the concept of a multi-tiered or at least layered application, capable of providing business logic for the following:

*	Recipe CRUD operations.

*	Ingredient CRUD operations.

*	Product CRUD operations.

as a prelude to of course...

*	Recipe Calculation operations.

I've implemented this layer as such to provide the possibility of utilizing these features from any number of clients, including that of a Unit Test project, which is a client of sorts. 

The features that have been implemented are those that are required for the fulfillment of the specification for the Recipe Calculator.
